# Parameterized-Quantum-Circuit-for-Building-a-Bell-State
In this project, we want to implement a circuit which returns |00⟩ and |11⟩ with equal probability. In other words, the output state of the circuit would be the first Bell state  |𝜓+⟩=1/√2(|00⟩+|11⟩)

The circuit is a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC), for more information you can see Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models, consisting only of CNOTs, RXs and RYs. Using optimization methods, the purpose is to find the parameters of this circuit in a way that the circuit ouputs |𝜓+⟩=1/√2(|00⟩+|11⟩)

Simulations are done by sampling, i.e. limited number of measurements per iteration and noise.
