# Parameterized-Quantum-Circuit-for-Building-a-Bell-State
In this project, we want to implement a circuit which returns |00⟩ and |11⟩ with equal probability. 

The circuit is a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) consisting only of CNOTs, RXs and RYs. Using optimization methods, the purpose is to find the parameters of this circuit in a way that the circuit ouputs |𝜓+⟩=1/√2(|00⟩+|11⟩)

Simulations are done by sampling, i.e. limited number of measurements per iteration and noise.
